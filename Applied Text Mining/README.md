# Applied Text Mining in Python

The course start with the basic text manipulations and learn to write [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) and search textual patterns in given the document. In the week 2, the learning of different textual distance metrics helps in building spelling recommender system. The week 3 focuses on application of machine learning algorithms on text data to segregate spam messages. 

Finally, course ended with a project on topic modelling where the topics are extracted using [gensim's](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) [LDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) model from a group of news data with separating the sparse clusters of news into different distributions of words, which are basically topics. Also, build a paraphrase quality predictor with document path similarity method.

The use of [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) library is the main learning of this course. IN this course, many different textual concepts including [POS tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging), [synset similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordNet), textual distances, [topic modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model) are learnt and applied.
