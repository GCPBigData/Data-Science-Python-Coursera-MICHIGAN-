# [Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting) 

The course starts with the theory of graph visualization and how graph lies and misleads the information. The principles of Alberto Cairo and concept [data-ink ratio](https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Data-Ink_Ratio) by Edward Tufte helps in building effective visualizations. In week 2, course focuses on [matplotlib architecture](https://www.aosabook.org/en/matplotlib.html) which is a crucial part of plotting and draws basic plots like scatterplots, line plots and bar charts. In the week 3, the course digs deeper into matplotlib architecture and works on [subplots](https://www.python-course.eu/matplotlib_multiple_figures.php) and [artist layer](https://matplotlib.org/users/artists.html) and draws more complex plots like boxplots, histograms and heatmaps and add animation and [interactivity](https://matplotlib.org/users/interactive.html) to these visualizations.

Finally, course ends with a project on using matplotlib visuals to address research questions.
