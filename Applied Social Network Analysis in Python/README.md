# Applied Social Network Analysis in Python

The course start with the basics of [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) package dealing with different network classes and node and edge attributes. In the week 2, course digs deeper and analyse the internal network connections of companies which is further extended to exploring different network metrics in week 3. The week 3 focuses on learning network influencing measures and concepts of network centralization. Here, it deals with metrics like [degree centrality](https://www.sci.unich.it/~francesc/teaching/network/degree.html), [betweenness centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality), [page rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), [hub authority score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm), etc.

Finally, course ended with a project on company email network where the future network predictions are drawn using all the measures listed above and the knowledge of networkx library.
