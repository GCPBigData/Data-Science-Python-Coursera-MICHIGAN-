# [Applied Machine Learning in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning)

The course start with the introduction to [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), a python machine learning library. In week 2, the elementary machine learning algorithms like [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression), [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression), [knn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm), [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree), [SVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine), etc. It also deals with the problem of overfitting and underfitting. Then, as a cure the concepts of regularization, kernels and cross validation are learnt. In week 3, it focuses on model evaluation and different metrics like [Precision-Recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall), [ROC curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic), [Confusion matrix](https://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/), etc.

Finally, course ends with the learning more complex models like [random forests](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-random-forest-algorithm-d457d499ffcd), [gradient boosts](https://medium.com/mlreview/gradient-boosting-from-scratch-1e317ae4587d) and [neural networks](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_96/journal/vol4/cs11/report.html) and also cover the theory of data leakages. It also goes to the unsupervised learning section and digs into dimensionality reduction and clustering.
